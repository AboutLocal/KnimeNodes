    <name>Elasticsearch Summary Reader</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Queries the specified elasticsearch summary index and retrieves resulting summaries. The server to connect to
        must be specified in the environment.conf. If the server is located in an external network an open ssh tunnel
        must exist, other wise the connection can not be estanblished.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Queries the specified elasticsearch summary index and retrieves the resulting summaries. The query
        can be specified in the dialog. In case the query string is empty a "match_all" query is used. The summaries
        are transformed into a data table containing the same columns as csv summaries. Maximal result size as well
        as chunk size can be set.

        <option name="Elasticsearch Query">The query to set. This query must be a valid elasticsearch query string.
        Please see lucene query syntax for detailed information.
        </option>
        <option name="Max. Results">The maximal number of resulting summaries to retrieve.</option>
        <option name="Chunk Size">The number of summaries to retrieve in one chunk. Note that if you have limited
        memory (which may most likely be the case) increase the chunk size carefully. For each chunk a query is
        send to elasticsearch, meaning that a too small chunk size will result in many queries and thus slow down the
        retrieving process.</option>
